		<h1 class="service-page-title">Managed Hosting</h1>
		<p>Hosting choices play a major role in a website’s&nbsp;ongoing performance, security, and ability to scale. Harris Web Works provides a wide range of hosting services, including&nbsp;consulting on configuring the best set up for your Magento, Drupal, Joomla or WordPress site. <a href="https://www.harriswebworks.com/our-team/">Our team includes Magento and Amazon Web Services certified experts</a> and&nbsp;dedicated project managers who will gain in-depth understanding of your site.</p>
		<p>Managed hosting is available for business, enterprise, ecommerce, enterprise global, and HIPAA websites. <a href="https://www.harriswebworks.com/managed-hosting/">See detailed explanation of managed hosting configurations and options.</a></p>
		<blockquote><p>With our managed hosting services, we take full responsibility for the upkeep of a website, including server, application, template, and content functionality.</p></blockquote>
		<p data-canvas-width="404.3159071214116">Our team gets to know each site, providing consistent and knowledgeable support. Managed hosting includes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Overseeing all back-end and front-end technologies to keep&nbsp;the site running smoothly</li>
			<li>Updating plug-ins and extensions as needed</li>
			<li>Prompt, personalized attention</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Hosting for eCommerce Sites</h2>
		<p>eCommerce businesses need the most reliable site speed, uptime, and disaster recovery protection, and they need their website framework to have the latest security patches. In addition to the above, our customized, high-performance hosting solutions for online stores include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Best-in-class hosting through <a href="https://www.harriswebworks.com/website-hosting-administration/hosting-magento-amazon-cloud/">Amazon Web Services&nbsp;(AWS),</a> managed by certified professionals</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.harriswebworks.com/website-hosting-administration/geolocation-ecommerce-magento/">Global deployment – load-balanced, multi-region, multi-server</a></li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Hosting for Corporate and Service Business Sites</h2>
		<p>Enterprise level secure hosting is the preferred path for corporate clients who need top tier security and staging environments for their websites. Our experience includes setting up and managing hosting platforms for healthcare, life sciences, and biopharmaceutical sites, all of which require very precise handling of data and content. Options for corporate enterprise hosting include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Development, staging and production servers&nbsp;using<strong>&nbsp;</strong>SYNC Staging<sup>TM</sup><strong>,&nbsp;</strong>our proprietary&nbsp;website publishing tool</li>
			<li>HIPAA-compliant data collection, storage and retrieval, and&nbsp;HIPAA-compliant firewalls for <a href="https://www.harriswebworks.com/web-design-development/hipaa-development-services/">healthcare websites</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>Business-level managed hosting is ideal for local service companies where they don’t have the&nbsp; time, expertise or patience needed to handle hosting-related set up and maintenance. This provides convenience, peace-of-mind and just the right amount of hosting resources needed to keep the website running smoothly.</p>
		<h2>Ongoing Website Administration</h2>
		<p>In conjunction with our hosting services, we also provide ongoing <a href="https://www.harriswebworks.com/website-administration/">website administration services for WordPress, Drupal, Magento and Joomla sites.</a>&nbsp;It’s our mission to be an extension of your business, helping to keep your website updated and running smoothly.</p>
